# Test Ecommerce site
## for setting google analytics with Rails

It's not serious. I just made it for a testing for google ecommerce tracking. Actually it's not useful for you. As I'm a beginner with Rails there are a lot of tutorial stuff and so on.

My Goal is to make a site for enhanced ecommerce tracking.
